# BIKE RENT COUNTS PROJECT
## Project goal
The informal aim of this project was to test my data analytical skills and build a linear regression model to predict bike rentals based on the provided data. It turned out the data correlation between the features and the target variable is not linear enough to build an effective linear regression model. I attempted to do so anyway, if only to test the theory. The resulting model performed poorly, but could be improved upon further (e.g. be fixing the negative predictions made by the model). I then built a Decision Tree Regression model, which achieved significantly better results.</br>
</br>
The project is completed, however much can be improved in the model through further data regularization and hyperparameter tuning. In the future I would like to transform the underlying data even further for model efficiency's sake (e.g. log transformations, Ridge regularization) and test a different regression model within this project.</br>
